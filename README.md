# EggTimer
EggTimer tutorial project

This egg timer is a project based off the tutorial project from Angela Yu's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy.

Some of the challenges in this app were working with the progress view while also trying to trigger a countdown timer. It was fun to incorporate AVAudioPLayer to have the alarm sound at the end and learning to connect user initiated actions to functions.
